Association Mapping
==================
In enterprise applications the main intentions of Associations  is to improve data navigations between entities and to improve communication between entities. 

in Object oriented Data Model. we are able to achieve associations by declaring one or Collection of reference variables of entity class in another entity class.

In Relational Data Model we are able to achieve associations in following three ways:

1. by defining primary key Foreign key relations between tables.
2. By providing join column between tables.
3. by defining join table between two tables.

to resolve the associations mismatch between both data models hibernate has provided
Hibernate Association mappings

1. One-To-One Association
2. One-To-many
3. Many-To-One
4. Many-To-Many
================================================
1. One-To-One Association Mapping
================================================
it is a relation between entities where one instance of entities should be mapped with exactly one instance of another entity.

ex: Every Employee Must have exactly one individual Account.
ex: Every Employee Must have exactly one Address.


1. One-To-Many Association Mapping
================================================
it is a relation between entities where one instance of entities should be mapped with exactly one instance of another entity.

ex: Every Employee Must have exactly one individual Account.
ex: Every Employee Must have exactly one Address.

2. One-To-many Association Mapping
==================================
it is a relation between entities where one instance of entities should be mapped with multiple instance of another entity.

ex: single department has multiple Employees 

3. Many-To-One Association Mapping
==================================
it is a relation between entity classes, where multiple instances of an entity should be mapped with single instance of another entity.
ex:
===
many students have joined with singe branch 

4. Many-To-Many Association
===========================
a Many-To-Many association is a relationship between two entity classes. where multiple instances of one entity are associated with multiple instance of another entity

in simple terms
===============
One record in table a can be linked with many records in table B.
and each record in table B can be linked with many records in table A.

example
=======
a student can enroll in multiple course
a course can have multiple students

multiple students are joined multiple courses
